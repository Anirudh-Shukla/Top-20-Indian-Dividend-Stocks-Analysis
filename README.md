## Introduction:
The objective is to assess the performance and consistency of dividend payments, evaluate the overall financial health of companies, and analyze their risk-return profiles using historical financial data.

## Data Sources:
Historical stock prices and dividend data for 50 companies listed on the Nifty 500 index were collected using the yfinance library. The data covers 5 years.

## Data Processing:
1. Data cleaning involves handling missing values and preparing the data for analysis.
2. Descriptive statistics were calculated, including mean, median, standard deviation, and dividend yield.
3. Visualizations were created using matplotlib and seaborn libraries.

## Analysis Methodology:
1. Performance metrics such as total returns and annualized returns were calculated.
2. Risk was assessed using standard deviation.
3. The Sharpe ratio was used as a risk-adjusted performance measure.
4. A ranking system was developed based on criteria including dividend yield and Sharpe ratio.
5. Companies were analyzed for their dividend consistency, financial health, and risk-return profiles.

This structured approach ensures a transparent and reproducible analysis, providing valuable insights for long-term investment decisions in dividend-paying Indian companies.
